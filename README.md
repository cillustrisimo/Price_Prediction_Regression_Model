## Random Forest Regression Price Prediction Model

This repository contains my Jupyter Notebook working on creating a <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers">"Bluebook for Bulldozers"</a> as part of an older Kaggle competition. The goal was to create a regression model that could predict the price of bulldozers, and the main evaluation metric was RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Log Error).

The final model created boasts around a .24~ RMSLE, which at the time of the competition would've placed this model somewhere in the top 30 out of 477 candidates.

For more details on information such as features taken into consideration, as well as the contained graphs and analysis, please view the jupyter notebook. The environment has also been prepackaged in a YML file for easy setup,
and the model is contained in a joblib file.

Thanks for taking interest in my second ever model and my learning process!
